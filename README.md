# SuggestionApp

This repository is a project focused on learning and exploring the capabilities of Blazor, .NET 6, and MongoDB. 

Throughout the project, I will be implementing various features, such as user authentication/authorization, CRUD operations, real-time updates, to showcase the integration and functionality of Blazor, .NET 6, and MongoDB.

The app allows users to make a suggestion and post it on the main page as well as upvote suggestions they like. These suggestions can be moderated by admins, who can decide to archive/reject a suggestion if not appropriate.
